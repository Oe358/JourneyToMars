                    <h3>Q. You are the deputy director of D.A.R.P.A.’s Tactical Technology Office, can you please describe what D.A.R.P.A and the Tactical Technology Office do?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. DARPA is a federal agency in the department of defense formed after an event that surprised the whole world – Sputnik.  We were taken by complete surprise.  DARPA formed to create breakthroughs – so we would never have another Sputnik moment again, but instead be giving other countries Sputnik moments.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. One project the the Tactical Technology Office is currently working on is ways for the military to cope with hostile unmanned aircrafts, what are other problems the the TTO is currently working to solve?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. Well we are working on a number of things. Currently getting to space is incredibly expensive– we are working on a reusable rocked- trying to demonstrate capability to relaunch 10 times in 10 days which saves enormous costs and time. We are working on having robots repair them instead of people which would allow us to repair satellites farther away from earth. At the moment most vehicles that the army uses are armored so that they are not destroyed by bombs. However, at D.A.R.P.A. we are working on making vehicles more mobile so that they can simply avoid those bombs.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. Before you became the deputy director of D.A.R.P.A.’s Tactical Technology Office you were a space shuttle commander logging more than 38 days in space. What was your time in space like?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. It was a lot of fun. My crew and I did a lot of spacewalks in order to build the International Space Station.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. What made you decide to become an astronaut?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. Mainly the Apollo program, I had always wanted to explore new places and the idea of landing on the moon sounded great to me. Unfortunately I never got to land on the moon, but my generation got to build the International Space Station.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. What was the one of the largest challenges you faced while in space?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. When I was commander on the space shuttle – we had to move a solar array and it ripped.  The solar array is continually electrified; you have to be careful not to touch it with your hand or the robotic arm…Pretty intense.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. With the recent development of private space companies such as SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, do you think that the future of space exploration lies in the private sector?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. I think their work is really exciting – a lot of happening in commercial arena.  I think it’s similar to a time before aviation was open to everyone.  In the beginning most people never imagined they would be flying all around the country…now we don’t even think about it.  I think government will still have the biggest role.  That’s the place that most of the technological advances still come.  The commercial field is using mature technologies that were developed by government in exciting ways that the government never imagined. They will have a large part in colonizing Mars like when the pilgrims came to America on private boats.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. What are your views on humans inhabiting or colonizing other planets such as Mars, and if you were offered the opportunity to go would you?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. I would certainly love to go but I have a grandson so I’ll leave that to your generation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. I know that you must get this question a lot but what is it like being in space and looking down at Earth?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. Hard to explain. It’s very humbling. When you look down during the day you see all nature; mountains, rivers you can’t really see people, but at night, the only thing you see is people because you only see where the lights are and that’s where human beings are. And the sunsets are really spectacular. </h3>
