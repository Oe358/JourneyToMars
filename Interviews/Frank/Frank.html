                    <h3>Q.  How did you get from a sculpture degree to driving a rover?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A.  That’s an interesting question. After I got my sculpture degree I got interested in computer animation similar to sculpture in some ways, and I moved out to California. And there I got a job at JPL in computer animation I wasn't doing anything associated with the mars rovers but eventually the opportunity came to do some software meant to help people drive Mars rovers. I saw a picture in the JPL newspaper about the guy who was going to be driving the rover so I called him and asked him if I could show him the software that I had been working on and he said yes. It was useful and I started working with him and from that first rover we decided to land two more Rovers and because I had lots of experience with the rovers I got to drive them.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. How has your arts degree impacting you drive the rover?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. I would say that art and engineering have a lot in common. You have to make something great out of what you have. With both things you have to first imagine something and then create it in the physical world. I also think that sculpture is concerned with things in 3 dimensions and shapes and that is lot of what has to do with understanding what situation the rover is in right now.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. Is it challenging trying to understand what is happening on Mars?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. The time delay is so long that we don’t drive the rover the way that you would drive a remote control car with a camera on top. Because the time delay is so long, about 15 minutes, by the time you saw that you were driving towards a rock and turned to hit the rock you would have already crashed. Instead we program a day worth of stuff for it to do. And that is the job, figuring out how to get it accomplish something.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. How do you decide what the rover will do each day?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. We have a team of scientists from all over the world who coordinate what the rover is going to do each day. When they figure that out they tell us and we figure out the best way to get that done. We have an idea of where we are going but each and everyday there are little changes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. What are the largest challenges for you while programming the rover?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. We need to keep the rover safe. There are rocks that you can run into, sand (which is particularly treacherous), and we are also on Mars so we don’t know one hundred percent what is going to happen. The rover can drive itself around a rock, it is a little bit smart but we need to do most of the work for it.  Keeping the rover and it’s arm safe is our number one job. Our number two job is trying to accomplish the things that the scientists have asked for.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. What do you do if you run into an obstacle that you didn't know was there?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. We have to very careful about how we drive. The rover takes a lot of pictures and we have a way of displaying those images in a virtual reality type thing. If we were driving towards a large hill and we can’t see beyond it we would stop once we didn't know what was going to come next. Sometimes, if things look very promising we allow the vehicle to start taking its own pictures and it can start keeping itself safe.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. How do you train to pilot the rover?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. We have a course that takes about a year. We have classroom training that sometime I teach and after you finish all the classroom training you do something called shadow, where they get to watch someone pilot the rover. When the pilot feels that they are ready the person shadowing is allowed to drive the rover but the pilot is still there to make sure nothing happens.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. Do you think humans will be able to set foot on Mars soon?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. I don’t see any reason why we couldn't. It would certainly be more difficult than going to the moon; the moon takes four days while the Mars takes six months. It will certainly provide many interesting opportunities and challenges for future engineers but I think that if we as a country decide to do it it will happen.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. What new capabilities will the 2020 rover have compared to the Curiosity?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. The mars 2020 rover has a very interesting rover has a very interesting new idea behind it. The main idea behind it is something we call caching samples where the rover drills up some rock and stores it in a sealed tube. It’s gonna collect a large number of these tubes and at a certain point it is going to deposit these tubes so that a future mission can come and bring them back to Earth. This is one step forward in the exploration of Mars because now we can use all the instruments that we have here on Earth which are much more extensive than what we can fit on the rover to analyze the rock.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. If you could walk on Mars would you?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. I guess it depends on how long the shift would be. I don’t know that I would want to leave my daughter for six months there and six months back that would be a long time. When I was younger there was no doubt that I would have been willing to go but I think I’ll have to leave to the future generations of astronauts.</h3>
