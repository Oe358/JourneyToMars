                    <h3>Q. Could you tell me more about planet formation and astrobiology?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. That area is trying to understand a couple things. We know about our own solar system, we know that planets formed around our sun and we know that life arose on Earth, as far as we know, is the only place in the solar system that has life. But it is always hard when you only have one example of something to understand how it works wo what we are trying to do is understand more generally how planets form and how they might be different in other places. We are starting to get evidence that planets like Earth or at least the size of Earth are pretty common around other stars. What we aren’t entirely sure of yet is what the conditions are one those planets. Astrobiology is the intersection between understanding life and understanding astronomy.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. How were you drawn to the field of astronomy?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A.  I didn’t get interested in astronomy until college. When I was younger i was interested in science. And when I got to college I had a friend who had always wanted to be an astronomer and it was talking to her that got me thinking that astronomy could be pretty cool. And it wasn’t even on my radar as a job.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. What have been some of the most interesting moments for you during you career?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. One of the interesting things about doing research is that often the questions that you are trying to answer are pretty small. One moment that sticks out for me is when I was getting my Phd I started a side project and there were a couple stars that people had noticed that were a little odd. People weren’t quite sure how old they were. And one way to tell is that young stars emit a lot more light in the form of x-rays so we had to request time with a special telescope that could see x-rays and we found out that the star was pretty young. That was really cool because for a little bit I was one of two people in the entire world that knew that.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. What specific conditions are required to support life as we know it on a planet?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. People have thought a lot about what is required for life. We don’t know for sure because we have never found other life but the big picture is that we want it to be similar conditions to Earth. We want it to be stable if it’s changing a lot getting very hot and very cold in a short period of time that’s not good. Probably a solid surface. And that’s one of the nice things about water actually it is hard to change water’s temperature without inputting or taking out a lot of energy so it often makes planets stable. You need energy so sunlight. And probably an atmosphere because it makes the conditions more stable. We don’t know for sure but that is what we think would be needed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. Recently there have been a lot of new planets discovered. What is the chance that they are habitable or that there is life already on them?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. I think that the chance is pretty high that some of them are habitable. That is something that we can know for sure in the next decade or so. As far as them already having life on them we don’t really know. The big thing about life on earth is that we don’t know how it happened. So because we don’t know how it happened we don’t know how easy it can happen. My guess is that it is pretty common so I would imagine that some of those planets have life on them.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. When life forms on a planet do those planets tend to be young or old?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. We have good evidence on Earth that life arose pretty early, but right after a planet forms the conditions aren’t right for life. It’s too hot, often the planet is being bombarded by meteors. On Earth as soon as the planet settled down and those conditions became more stable, we have evidence from fossils, that life arose relatively early. So maybe simple life could start on young planets, but evolution takes time so you probably won’t get complex life until the planets are older. So by that I mean that the planets are maybe a few billion years old.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. When a star forms how long does it take until planets form around that star?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. So planets and stars form together; the star forms in the middle and then the stuff orbiting around it turns into the planets. And we think that it takes somewhere between one to ten million years for planets to form and then maybe for those planets to be stable about one hundred million years old.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. Does that mean that relatively young stars would be more likely to have life than old stars or vice versa?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. Maybe any type of star. The very oldest stars in our galaxy, the very oldest stars formed at a time in our Universe when there were only a few elements; only hydrogen and helium. So really old stars like 10 billion year old stars probably won’t have planets but really anything younger than that could.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. What are the biggest challenges that you faced in your work?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. I would say the biggest challenge, and this is true for astronomy in general is how far away things are. The stars and planets that I study are trillions of miles away, so we can point telescopes at them but it is always a challenge to figure out what that information is telling us because we can’t see them that closely.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. What are the biggest questions still remaining in astronomy?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. I think the really big one is how does life form and is it hard or easy for that to happen. It’s definitely going to be a hard one to answer but that is something that we should try to do.</h3>
