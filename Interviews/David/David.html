                    <h3>Q. What is your current job, what projects are you working on and who do you work for?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. Right now I work for a company called Athentek, A-T-H-E-N-T-E-K. I’m doing development for indoor tracking. We develop little tracking devices and infrastructure for high accuracy tracking, so if you were in a mall or hospital and wanted to know where precisely where you are, we are developing technology that would let you do that.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. How is that relevant to your degrees in aerospace and aeronautics?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. My aerospace background was in gps, so I got my PhD in gps technology. That’s all location stuff. So when I got my degree and shortly thereafter it was for gps location, so between indoor and outdoor location. Tracking cars and planes and also animals.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. What are challenges you have run into?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. The biggest one is that you don't even know what the problem is. When someone comes to you and say that they want a positioning system and you ask what the requirements are they say, “you tell me.” I have to come up with what the problem actually is, I have to come up with a way to see how well I’m doing and I have to come up with a way of testing it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. Do you find that annoying, or do you enjoy the freedom it gives you?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. That’s why I do this job, I’m not a person that wants to do the same thing day in and day out. The fact that I get to solve a unique problem that nobody else has solved is what keeps me coming back, and that I’m working on the whole thing, not a widget that is part of a larger system.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. What did you do for Lockheed Martin?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. I did studies on space systems. It was special programs, which means it was classified work, but I was doing the same kind of computer analysis that engineers would do on an open project, I was just doing it on a closed project.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. What got you interested in all this stuff?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. I think it was probably two things; I liked cars as a kid. I got my first car when I was 16 and worked summer jobs and got my second car when I was 18. I did a lot of work on them. I replaced parts and went drag racing. My dad, before he would give me driving lessons gave me a maintenance book and said, “first read these chapters,” so not college degree or anything I had to read this big automotive textbook thing. And the second thing was my part-time job when I was in my senior year of high school was at an engineering firm. And the guy was building boats and sonar systems to study the reservoirs of dams. And I thought it was really cool.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. If you were offered the opportunity to go to space would you say yes?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. Oh yes, definitely.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q. And what would you look forward to doing while in space?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A. I think I would look down at the Earth. When I fly in an airplane I enjoy looking at the Earth, so I think I would spend a lot of time doing that.</h3>
