            <p><span class = "indent"></span>"It's important to continue going into space and to other planets like Mars.
                Maybe it will become more important in the future because of overpopulation and pollution...
                I'm not really interested in any jobs involving space but they sound cool...
                I do think that private space agencies are important because they can fund themselves and continue to explore.
                Like if they want to go Mars like SpaceX does they can do it without the government looking over their shoulder."</p>

            <p><span class = "indent"></span>"I think that Mars has the potential to be really important.
                We don't know what resources are there, there could be oil and other important valuable stuff.
                I don't really think I would be that interested in any space related careers.
                I do think that private space companies have some potential, but I also think that they could be dangerous because there aren't a lot of regulations on them."</p>

            <h2>We Think...</h2>
            <img src = "Logo.png" alt = "A logo that says 'M2M'.">
            <p><span class = "indent"></span>We believe that going to different planets, such as Mars is good academically but do not think that it is realistic to have normal humans live there.
                Privatizing space exploration has its pros and cons.
                It will probably help speed up space exploration, however since the private organizations probably wont be non-profits, their goals might lean more on the making money side than the exploring space side.
                However, these different companies will create competition which might actually accelerate the rate at which we explore space.</p>
