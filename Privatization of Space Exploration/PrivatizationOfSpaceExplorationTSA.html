        <h3>Ways to Explore Our Universe and the Privatization of Space Exploration</h3>

        <figcaption id = "first-caption">A picture of the Hubble Telescope orbiting Earth</figcaption>
        <p><span class = "indent"></span>Since the age of the telescope mankind has been striving to explore, explain, and map our universe.
            To this effect we have developed marvelous new technologies; rockets, satellites, telescopes, rovers, and space probes.
            However, even with all of this progress humans have yet to set foot on another planet.
            In addition the interest in space exploration has also declined since the space race which has resulted in decreased funding for government entities such as NASA.
            This means that they do not have the budget to complete many projects that they could.
            To fill the role of NASA companies such SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and Blue Origin have stepped up to fill their shoes sending satellites and probes into space.
            The future of space technology is still changing and will continue to advance through both private companies and government organizations.</p>
        <h4>New Ways to Explore Space</h4>
        <p><span class = "indent"></span>Currently, we use a variety of space instruments to explore space, and most of them are devices similar in use to the telescope.
            Notable examples include telescopes such as the Hubble and Kepler, NASA's Cassini and New Horizons probes.
            These are all devices used to explore the deepest corners of our solar system. The Hubble is a space telescope that was launched in 1990 in a low orbit around Earth and the Kepler telescope trails Earth in its own heliocentric orbit.<br><br>

            <figcaption id = "second-caption"><span class = "indent"></span>A picture of Saturn, taken by the Cassini probe.</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
            <span class = "indent"></span>On October 15, 1997, a Titan IVB/Centaur rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral carrying the Cassini orbiter, starting the probe’s seven-year journey to Saturn.
            During those seven years, Cassini conducted flybys of Venus, Earth, and finally Jupiter, each time receiving a substantial gravity assist due to the slingshot effect.
            During that time it also traveled through the asteroid belt and did experiments on dust it collected.
            The first thing Cassini did upon its arrival at Saturn in 2004 was to discover two new moons, Methone and Pallene.
            In December of 2004, Cassini launched the Huygens probe to the surface of Saturn’s moon Titan.
            Since then, Cassini has been taking pictures of and collecting data on Saturn and its Moons and will continue to do so until the conclusion of the mission at the end of this year.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class = "indent"></span>Launched in January 2006, New Horizons began its journey to dwarf planet Pluto, which it completed in July 14, 2015.
            The New Horizons mission involved not only the Cassini Probe, but the Hubble telescope; the New Horizons team used images from said telescope to discover that pluto had four previously unknown moons: Nix, Hydra, Styx, and Kerberos.
            Until the probe reached Pluto, we didn’t know much about the icy sphere; we didn’t even have a clear photo of its surface, but New Horizons changed everything.
            NASA then extended the mission; in 2018 and 2019, the probe will pass Kuiper belt object 2014 MU69, and in in doing so will become the first craft ever to visit an object that had not yet been discovered when it was launched.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class = "indent"></span>Those are some of the current ways we explore space, but there are many ideas for the future of both manned and unmanned space exploration.
            One of the most famous ideas for helping astronauts explore space is suspended animation.
            It lets astronauts and other space travelers go to sleep during a trip to another planet or solar system.
            Although suspended animation is a concept that almost that seems to come from science fiction and is far off, NASA has been giving money to different organizations that research and develop technology to make suspended animation possible.
            Suspended animation could be be the future of space exploration; get into a rocket, go to sleep, wake up on Mars!<br><br>

            <figcaption id = "third-caption"><span class = "indent"></span>A picture of a Space Shuttle with its cargo bay door open.</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
            <span class = "indent"></span>Scientists have also said that space probes can be the future of the space industry because of their abilities to explore other planets without any astronauts.
            Recently, a space probe has been landed on a comet 317 million miles away and the Voyager 1 entered interstellar space and has become the first spacecraft to ever leave the solar system.
            Space probes are bound to dominate the future space industry because of their speed and the possibilities of interstellar travel.
            In addition the invention of the ion propulsion system in 1999 has advanced the travel capabilities of mankind.
            Because ion engines can run only on solar energy, a vehicle powered by it could travel indefinitely as long as there is a star nearby.
            There have been numerous proposals of creating giant arks that travel with entire societies and ecosystems to different stars.
            Unfortunately, for this to happen gigawatt scale power for construction is needed.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class = "indent"></span>Another proposed method is the generation ship.
            What would happen is it would be a slow journey with the astronauts who started the trip would have kids, raise them, then die.
            Their descendants would finish the journey depending on how far they are travelling.
            There might also be sleeper ships.
            These ships will suspend the astronauts in suspended animation.
            They would “sleep” until it is necessary for them to wake.
            A theoretical possibility is a ship with frozen embryos.
            They would eventually hatch and be raised to pilot the ship.
            These proposals if accepted will allow humans to travel farther than ever before and we will have no limits on how far we can go.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class = "indent"></span>The fast paced missions have a few proposed vehicles.
            One is a spaceship that would continually increase the speed at which it is traveling.
            These types of spaceships consume a lot of fuel, and in comparison to the distances we must travel, it would be extremely difficult to supply that much fuel.
            We also simply do not have the technology currently to go as fast as we need, but scientists are still trying to find new ways to go quickly through space.</p>
        <h4>Private Companies that are making Strides in Exploring Space</h4>
        <p><span class = "indent"></span>Recently several private companies have been increasingly involved in space exploration, including these are: SpaceX, Armadillo Aerospace, and Blue Origin.
            These companies have sprouted from the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004, which effectively made private space exploration legal.
            These companies have been expanding and accelerating how we explore space.
            SpaceX, arguably the most innovative private space company in the world, has been leading this industry since they successfully put a payload in Earth’s orbit in 2008.
            SpaceX has since sent several rockets to the ISS with cargo and has big plans to colonize Mars.
            Recently they announced that they would even send two private citizens to the moon in 2018.<br><br>

            <img id = "fourth-pic" src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/SpaceX-Logo.svg/2000px-SpaceX-Logo.svg.png" alt = "The SpaceX logo.">
            <figcaption id = "fourth-caption"><span class = "indent"></span>The SpaceX logo.</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p><span class = "indent"></span>Other strides that SpaceX has made to accelerate the space industry includes creating reusable rockets and making a more powerful version of the Falcon 9.
            Another private company, Boeing, has created a seven person capsule, the CST-100 and has supplemented the US’s ability to send people into space.
            Virgin Galactic has recently created SpaceShipTwo, a suborbital passenger plane.
            All these private companies are helping to advance the way we travel and explore the vast expanse of space.
            Clearly, the private sector of this industry has been and will continue to expand this versatile industry.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class = "indent"></span>Although there is a big movement to hand over space exploration to private industries, some are arguing intensely against this.
            An example of this is Charles Krauthammer, who is against decreasing the government's presence in space, claiming that during the transition from government to private industry, other countries like China and Russia will take control of Space.
            Others go at it from a different angle, saying that there is a national pride of having NASA that has been instilled into everyone since the space race of the 1960s, and if NASA were to be shut down, people would lose interest in the Space industry.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class = "indent"></span>However, others fight back.
            Esther Dyson, of foreign policy, makes an analogy to how the US government started the internet, but then handing it over to private industries.
            If they had not done this, the internet may have never evolved into what it is today.
            Maybe the same will happen with the Space industry.
            Overall, it is still a heated argument about whether or not the job of exploring space should remain in the government’s hands or be passed along to the private industry.
        </p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p><span class = "indent"></span>Overall, new technologies and methods are appearing that help in exploring the vast expanse of space meanwhile the private industry is slowly but surely taking over space exploration.
            The privatization of space exploration seems to be speeding up all of our space endeavors, making it safer and easier for us to explore space.
