                    <p><span class = "indent"></span>On March 2, 1972 the Pioneer 10 was launched into space.
                        It’s destination, Jupiter.
                        During the last stage of its launch the Pioneer 10 reached a speed of 52,000 kilometers per hour.
                        It was the fastest man-made spacecraft to leave Earth.
                        The Pioneer 10 was going so fast that it could go by the moon only 11 hours after launch and went passed Mars in only 12 weeks.
                        <br>
                        <span class = "indent"></span>Four and a half months later the Pioneer 10 arrived at the asteroid belt.
                        Soon afterwards it reached Jupiter, capturing the first close-up pictures of this massive planet.
                        The Pioneer 10 discovered much about Jupiter that was previously unknown during this section of its long-trip.
                        Once Pioneer 10 passed Jupiter it continued on to the outer reaches of the solar system and kept on giving us valuable information about the Sun and our solar system.
                        On March, 31 1997 Pioneer 10 concluded its mission and on February 7, 2003 we finally lost contact with Pioneer 10.</p>

                        It helped us learn more about planets like Jupiter and took beautiful pictures of them.
                        It was the beginning of revolutionary space vehicles, it was the “Pioneer” of space.

                        Voyager 1 became the most distant human-made object in space in 1998 and exited the solar system in 2012.
                        Voyager also has a number of symbols that are meant to represent human lifestyle and culture if it ever comes into contact with alien life.</p>

                        SpaceShipOne was designed by Burt Rutan (head of Scaled Composites), who claims that the ideas for this project began as early as the 1990's.
                        SpaceShipOne is a research rocket and was made for suborbital flights.
                        It was an anomaly of its time, having a "care-free" configuration allowing an easy re-entry.
                        Soon after its first flight SpaceShipOne received a $10 million Ansari X Prize and immediately retired from active service.

                    <p><span class = "indent"></span>One of the most well-known, unmanned space vehicles ever was the "Curiosity" rover.
                        This rover was launched from earth for a one-way trip to Mars on November 26, 2011.
                        On August 6, 2012 it landed on the red-planet, its destination.
                        This entire expedition was for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.
                        <br>
                        <span class = "indent"></span>The Curiosity Rover's main job was to figure out if Mars ever did or ever will be able to be inhabited.
                        It told us all about Mars's current and past environment.
                        This rover analyzed tons of the rocks and minerals on Mars's surface to discover the planet's geology and climate.
                        It even discovered the Red Planet contains about 2 percent water by weight.
                        That means astronaut pioneers could extract roughly 2 pints (1 liter) of water out of every cubic foot (0.03 cubic meters) of Martian dirt they dig up.</p>

                        It also examined the planet's soil formation, structure, and chemical composition.

                    <p><span class = "indent"></span>The Ascender, a spacecraft designed similarly to other planes, it is designed to take off and land horizontally.
                        Like traditional aircraft it is supposed to use airports to take off and land.
                        The ascender first will use 2 jet engines to ascend to a height of 26,000 feet before switching to rocket power in order to reach a distance of 62 miles above Earth’s surface before returning with its jet engines.
                        Ascender was designed to be the first sub-orbital plane to carry passengers to space.</p>

                        <span class = "indent"></span>The most dangerous part of a spacecraft’s journey is at the beginning, during the take off.
                        We are defying gravity and going straight upwards, it is incredibly dangerous and the most deaths have happened during the take-off stage.
                        The Ascender could be revolutionary, the first spacecraft to horizontally take off.
                        This could save lives and bring the number of mission failures down considerably.
                        If the ascender is successful it will revolutionize the space industry.

                    <p><span class = "indent"></span>The Delta II space vehicle entered service in 1989.
                        The Delta II was an expendable launch vehicle that carried various items into space.
                        In 1988, the Air Force ordered 20 of these vehicles and NASA purchased Delta IIs for the launch of three Earth-observing satellites.
                        The Delta II has had 98 consecutive successful launches and there are two more launches expected in the next two years.
                        Delta II has been given the name of “NASA’s workhorse” for its capability to carry payloads to various locations in space.
                    <br>
                        <span class = "indent"></span>This unmanned rocket has carried and delivered a significant quantity of various items including the Mars Exploration Rovers.
                        Over the many years the Delta II has increased in size and payload capability.
                        The Delta II at first, could boost 100 pounds into earth’s low orbit; currently the Delta II has the capability to boost approximately 2,490 pounds. </p>

                        <span class = "indent"></span>The Delta II, throughout its existence has innovated and through technological advancements, has been NASA’s first choice in payload carriers.
                        Throughout the Delta II’s almost 30 years of service, space exploration has expanded from the abilities of the Delta II.
