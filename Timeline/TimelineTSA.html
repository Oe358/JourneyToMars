                <span class = "indent"></span>On April 24th, 1990, the field of cosmology was changed forever by the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope from the Space Shuttle Discovery.
                The massive (24,000 pounds) telescope uses a gyroscopic control system to maneuver without thrusters, and does so with a pointing accuracy of 0.007 arc-seconds.
                <br>
                <span class = "indent"></span>One unique piece of information about the Hubble is that anyone can submit a proposal for observation time to make observations.
                A panel of experts reads each proposal and decides which ones are to be granted.
                This is partially responsible for the reason so many discoveries can be traced back to this telescope.
                Hubble set in motion a new wave of discoveries and breakthroughs in the field of space exploration that is still going today.

                The Magellan spacecraft was able to radar map 98% of Venus’s surface. We lost contact with Magellan on October 12, 1994.

                This led the way to commercial space shuttles because he showed that people would want to do this.
                He started off the privatization of space exploration, prompting millionaires
                to hire scientists to research how to get into space.
                <br>
                <span class = "indent"></span>Dennis Tito was sent to the ISS in the Soyuz TM-32 spacecraft, and he came back in the Soyuz TM-31 spacecraft.
                To go into space, Tito had accepted by the Russian Federal Space Agency as a candidate for a commercial spaceflight.
                He succeeded in that task, and his trip was arranged by MirCorp.
                Before his trip, he received some criticism from NASA, them saying it wasn't appropriate for citizens to take a ride into space.
                Despite the criticism, he still went into space, starting the privatization of space exploration.

                <p><span class = "indent"></span>On October 11th, 2010, one day after SpaceX’s Success, former President Obama signed a legislation to make NASA focus all effort on exploring Mars and asteroids.
                    His mission was to see if we could inhabit Mars.</p>

                <span class = "indent"></span>This new law scrapped the previous moon-oriented goal.
                President Obama’s bill called for a 19 billion dollar budget for NASA in 2011.
                He wanted to go outside NASA’s comfort zone.
                They hadn’t thoroughly explored Mars until then, he decided it was time to start.
                He was also very focused on collecting resources from asteroids. He wanted to know if we could inhabit Mars, if we could live there.
                In addition, Obama added an extension for the International Space Station to at least 2020.
                <br>
                <span class = "indent"></span>We have a lot of problems here on Earth, and inhabiting Mars could fix some of them.
                This legislation made NASA focus efforts on exploring Mars and asteroids.
                Could this mean we could go to Mars sooner than we thought? Will we soon be able to harvest asteroids for resources safely?

                <span class = "indent"></span>On May 22nd, 2012,  SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft carried cargo to the International Space Station under commercial agreements the company had with NASA at the time. It was the first private spacecraft to berth with the ISS. After its cargo delivery, SpaceX began developing a human version of the Dragon to eventually bring astronauts to the space station, which would be another milestone for private companies.
                <br>
                <span class = "indent"></span>This spacecraft docking on a government space station was huge.
                Private companies finally got to the point where they are at the level where the government programs were at.
                The private companies still had a lot of work to do, but this was a major step up from 2 years ago, when SpaceX was able to safely send a spacecraft into space.
