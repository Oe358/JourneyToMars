                        There are many pros and cons of of sending ordinary humans into outer space, but how would it really affect us?
                        There are many things we have to keep in mind about the state of our kind and our Earth while we talk about colonization on other planets.
                        First of all, we are running out of resources here on Earth.
                        Most of our fossil fuels will be depleted in 110 years, and we need a way to get more, renewable energy may not not cut it.
                        There are also other resources like iron which could be easily mined in space, but is getting harder to acquire here on Earth.
                        Population is also a problem, we are currently sitting pretty at 7 billion people.
                        But it is estimated that in late 2055, we will reach a population of 10 billion people, which is the theoretical limit of people we can feed without having to worry too much about world hunger.
                        Exploring outer space may be necessary to solve these problems.

                    <p><span class = "indent"></span>Even though we worry about things like energy, resources, and population, we also have to worry about money.
                        Going up into space is going to cost an inconceivable amount of money.
                        Would it cost more money to fix our problems right now or use it to go into space?
                        Time is also a finite resource each one of us has, and this would take up a huge chunk of it.
                        It is true that NASA could have some astronauts living on Mars by the 2030’s, but that is only a possibility.
                        Ordinary people who aren’t qualified in space travel would have to wait much longer.
                        Even if we landed and lived on Mars, we would live in small, expensive, domes.
                        If we want Mars to become a planet where we can breath and roam freely on, we would have to wait around 100,000 years.
                        It may not be worth it to explore space when we can solve our own problems.</p>
                    <p><span class = "indent"></span>We could take years discussing the pros and cons of inhabiting other planets, but in the end, is it even possible?
                        Thankfully, the answer is yes, new technological advancements have made the dream colonizing other planets a reality.
                        But what would happen if we went and lived on other planets?
                        What will happen to us if humankind fails to explore and eventually inhabit other parts of our solar system?

                    <p><span class = "indent"></span>As a planet we do not have the ability to withstand the economical pains of branching out to other planets.
                        Earth has the ability to last for the needs of humans as we adapt to the changing environment.
                        Above all humans have the minds that fit our planet’s demands and that is the one thing that is truly necessary for our survival.
                        Is exploring other planets really necessary? Do the consequences outweigh the benefits?
                        There are many aspects to look at when thinking about the pros of staying here on our home planet, Earth.

                        There are many aspects to look at when thinking about the pros of staying here on our home planet, Earth.</p>
                    <p>
                        <span class = "indent"></span>Money is a resource that we have made extremely important in today’s world, and money is a resource that is going to be burned through in trying to colonize Mars.
                        Let’s start with the cost to get to Mars.
                        Space travel is extremely expensive, the Curiosity rover costed 1.8 billion dollars to be transported to Mars, and that is not including the cost to build it.
                        That was just a rover, now we shall talk about a space shuttle.
                        A 4.4 million NASA space shuttle, with fuel and oxygen stored inside it, would cost a total of 44 billion dollars to transport to Mars, not including the money build it and supply it with resources.
                        Add a team of 4 astronauts to the mix and it increases by 8.8 million, not including their food supply and the cost to make their supplies.
                        In total, the cost to transport 4 astronauts to Mars cost around 44.9 billion dollars.
                        If we add the cost of the fuel itself, the oxygen, and the food for the trip to Mars, we will end up at around 100 billion dollars.<br></p>
                    <p>
                        <span class = "indent"></span>Now we must talk about the expense of shelter.
                        An inflatable shelter on Mars that is 120m3 large would cost a total of 267 million dollars to build and use on Mars.
                        Note that this shelter is quite small, the average american home is around 223m3, 120m3 is a bit more than half of that.
                        This home would have nothing fancy in it, it would be quite bland and boring.
                        That is why we must include the cost of entertainment in our total cost.
                        The cost of a one minute phone call and the cost of sending an average sized email both cost the same, both coming in at 209.71 dollars.
                        The cost of a 3-minute long video on Youtube would cost 37.24 thousand dollars on Mars.
                        These numbers may not seem as large as the ones that were stated earlier, but know that four astronauts will watch multiple videos, send countless numbers of phone calls, and send a lot of emails throughout the day.<br>
                    </p>
                    <div id = "pros-img-one">
                        <img src = "Pros-Image-One.jpg" alt = "A bunch of white domes lined up, surrounded by solar panels and people in space suits.">
                        <figcaption>These would be the types of shelters we would live in on Mars, uncomfortable white domes</figcaption>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        <span class = "indent"></span>If NASA sends 4 astronauts to Mars, they also have to keep them alive.
                        On average, an adult needs the bare minimum of 1 gallon of water and 2 can of food each day to stay alive.
                        Remember that this is the bare minimum.
                        The cost of sending a year's worth of food for 4 astronauts and storing it would cost 168 million dollars.
                        This is only the bare minimum needed, if you added another 2 cans for each astronaut, a total of 4 can per person, this number would scale up to around 200 million dollars.
                        Sadly, 4 cans of food and 1 gallon of water is still not good for your health.
                        Thankfully, with intense cultivation methods and the tools necessary, an astronaut can farm certain parts of Mars to sustain themselves!
                        To our despair, to send the tools and seeds necessary for a single person to farm for themselves would cost 20.9 billion dollars.
                        Multiply this by 4 and you get the grand total of 83.6 billion dollars, the cost to have 4 astronauts farm and sustain themselves.<br></p>
                    <p>
                        <span class = "indent"></span>Add all of these numbers together and averaging the amount of times a human uses applications like texting to entertain themselves, we reach a grand total of 200 billion dollars.
                        The US's defence budget is 711 billion dollars, the 200 billion is a bit less than one-third of that.
                        If we saved the 200 billion dollars, we could use it for other purposes like contributing to solve world hunger or reducing climate change.
                        We could use this money to solve many of the cons of not inhabiting other planets, we don’t have to waste time on all of this!<br></p>
                    <p>
                        <span class = "indent"></span>All of us matter, no matter what you do or what you look like, you matter.
                        Our lives are each precious jewels, and we each only own one and you don’t want to lose it.
                        On our adventure to colonize other planets we could lose countless lives, for a countless number of reasons.
                        There are many things that could wrong in space, and many of those things could kill all of the the astronauts in a space shuttle.
                        From a small crack which could let all the air out, or a piece of debris that could hit a space shuttle, almost anything that does not go according to plan could ruin a space mission.<br>

                        <span class = "indent"></span>By staying here on Earth, we won’t have to risk astronaut’s lives.
                        We won’t have to hope that nothing goes wrong on the inflatable shelters on Mars, we won’t have to worry about having an unexpected incident kill many of our own people and make us lose all of our progress.
                        We don’t have to attempt to inhabit other planets, it isn’t worth the risk.<br></p>
                    <p>
                        <span class = "indent"></span>It was already stated that it would cost around 200 billion dollars to send and sustain 4 people on Mars.
                        It was not stated that sending them up into space and building their resources would take an enormous amount of time.
                        Let’s start with the amount of time it would take to reach Mars from Earth.
                        It would take around 300 days to reach Mars, and to prepare for this mission it would take around 2 years.
                        And for the astronauts that live there, it would be their entire lives, farming and living in a small, colorless, inflatable house.<br></p>
                    <p>
                        <span class = "indent"></span>Our goal for inhabiting Mars is to make it into a planet like Earth.
                        It is unreasonable to keep spending 100’s of billions of dollars to send a couple of people to Mars every few years.
                        That would not be practical, but neither is the idea to terraform Mars into an Earth-like planet.
                        To create a barely breathable atmosphere on Mars, it would take 100,000 years, according to Chris McKay, a planetary scientist at NASA.
                        Time isn’t the only thing that would make terraforming Mars difficult, if anything goes wrong there is a chance it could make Mars worse than it currently is.
                        And even if we somehow terraformed Mars perfectly in 100,000 years, all the problems that we are going to have on Earth will already have happened, and thousands of years of work would be for nothing.<br></p>
                    <p>
                        <span class = "indent"></span>Going and inhabiting other planets is not necessary.
                        We are a creative species, and with extra money and time we can think of a solution, even if it takes decades.
                        We have done the impossible before, like sending a man up into space, and we can do it again.
                        If you think joblessness with ruin our world, if you think we will have no solution to overpopulation, you would be surprised what we can do if we put our minds together.
                        We can stay here on our planet, where we are meant to be, we can solve our problems here, on our Earth.

                        Even our own home, our planet, is slowly dying because we produce so much toxic waste and gas.
                        If we do not explore and create another place to live and inhabit, we could suffer horribly.
                        There are many disastrous cons of not finding another planet to live on.<br>

                    <p><span class = "indent"></span>Since the 1900’s, our population has been booming.
                        30 years ago, we had 3.3 billion people alive on our Earth.
                        Today, we have 7.4 billion, and it is estimated that in the year 2100, there will be 11.2 billion people living here on our own planet.
                        This is a major problem that we would need to address if we decide to stay here on Earth.
                        Our planet’s theoretical human capacity is 10 billion people, and when we reach that limit we will begin to see that we do not produce enough food for everyone.
                        Unluckily for us, the day we reach that capacity is not to far.
                        Late in the year 2055, it is estimated we will have 10 billion people living that day, our theoretical capacity.
                        Slowly as we begin to consume more and more food than we can produce, we will have a shortage.
                        We can fix this by inhabiting other planets and farming there.
                        Unlike most people think, space isn’t so much of a problem.
                        We can easily find more space, but at the sacrifice of nature, parks, and historic landmarks.
                        Are these wonders of Earth worth ruining when we can just go to other planets?<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><span class = "indent"></span>Scientists have approximated that our natural resources will not last as long as people may think.
                        Oil is expected to run out in 53 years and natural gas in 54.
                        One of our most important resources is coal, and that is supposed to run out in about 110 years.
                        The threat of running out of natural resources shows how much people have used very recently.
                        Most of these fossil fuels were formed anywhere between 541 million and 66 million years ago, and we are going to run out of all of them in the next century, when we have only been using them for 200 years.
                        What will we do when we run out? We won’t be able to do much, but that is a consequence of not going to space.
                        In space, asteroids have been thought of to be large mining station that we use, like pit stops.
                        But if we are chained here on Earth, we won’t be mining any asteroids any time soon.<br>

                    <p><span class = "indent"></span>Global warming is a real issue and threat in our society and it is getting much worse.
                        Everyday, our atmosphere is being polluted by greenhouse gases, produced from all the fossil fuels we burn.
                        Studies show that in 2015 global warming made weathers more extreme than ever before.
                        2015 was recorded as being the warmest year on the planet, shattering the previous record from 2014 just 12 months prior.
                        As earth’s ice begins to melt, sea levels will rise and the amount of rock land space will decrease greatly.
                        This would not be a problem if we had an entire other planet to inhabit.
                        This decrease in livable land will leave people without many comfortable places to live, and nowhere for food to grow.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><span class = "indent"></span>Job loss and homelessness are predicted to be a major byproduct from overpopulation.
                        In 2055, with a population of 10 billion, jobs will not be easy to get.
                        With new technology, robots are taking our jobs now, imagine what it would look like with the population over 10 billion.
                        Every street corner there would be a family with children, begging for food.
                        There would be no more parks for them to take shelter in, we would have used all of the space for apartments.
                        Poverty would spread like a wildfire, our Earth would be a dystopian future.
                        Inhabiting other planets would fix all of this, many new jobs would rise, jobs like farming and researching.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><span class = "indent"></span>Inhabiting other planets is a mission that we must accomplish.
                        We must cultivate it, we must grow food on it, we must populate it.
                        It would solve many of our problems that will soon come, we won’t have to face the disastrous consequences of only staying here on Earth.
